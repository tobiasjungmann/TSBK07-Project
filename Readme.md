## Time estimations
- wasd movement of the submarine - mouse cursor to use the camera to move in the third dimension - ==1.week==
- cockpit of the submarine - very simple, just a rectangle somewhere, adapt the style later on -  ==1. week== + transparency for the glass texture
- Collision detection ==1. week== -> **lab 4 finished before**
	- Ground
	- Fish
	- (water surface)
- procedural map generation ==3. week== -> **lab 4 finished before**
- Fish movement 
	- Just moving around of random fish -> ==1.week== - should have the collision detection
	- Swarm moving -> ==3. week==
- Lighting
	- ==3. week== submarine light
	- ==4. week== optional sunrays
	- ==4. week== particles / bubbles
- ==5. week==
	- game design - change of scenery based on the submarine light - one button can toggle it


- skybox -Repalce later with  ocean art
- coolrion detecction movement -> addd from lab 4 structure -> optimize
- cubes for fish collision detection
- Overlay -> for submarine -> inverted skybox
